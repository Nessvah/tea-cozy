# Tea-cozy - Practice Project

## Description

In this project I created a fictional website for a tea shop.<br>
This project and all the image assets are provided by Codecademy, from the Front-End Engineer career path.<br>
They provide the design spec and the image assets to help along the way. Everything else is done entirely by me.<br>
This web page it's not yet fully responsive so viewing it on mobile may cause layout issues.

### Challenges that I encountered

In this project I had to practice flexbox and although, I know the teory of how it works,<br>
I still had difficulties to layout everything according to the specs that I was giving<br>
and making the layout responsive on smaller sizes.
